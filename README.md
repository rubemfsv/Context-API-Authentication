# Context API Studies

This is a very simple authentication project in React Native to study how context creation works. This app makes the API call to the backend on the Login route, and if the user is authenticated, it shows the authenticated route to the Dashboard. In addition uses asyncstorage, determines the route stack in react navigation when it is logged in or not, in addition to creating the context in the entire application and using its own hook that is created.

### What this project covers:

* React Native w/ Hooks
* Context API
* AsyncStorage
* React Navigation Stack
* Hooks creation
